# Frontend Overview

## Structure
The frontend is divided into two main applications:
1.  **Web:** React-based admin and user portal.
2.  **App:** Flutter-based native mobile application.

## Shared Design
Both Web and App follow the same layout design principles.
See `frontend/layout.md` for specific layout details.
